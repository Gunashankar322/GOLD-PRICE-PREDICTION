# GOLD-PRICE-PREDICTION
Gold price prediction is the application of science and technology to predict the future gold price.
It is important because gold is one of the precious metals that is used for funding trading purchases. The countries with gold deposits are considered as the prosperous nations and our prediction models will also be beneficial for investors, and central banks to decide when to invest in this commodity
Hence we use machine learning algorithm for analyzing the relation between the variables and predict the gold price!
For developing the model, we used the Random forest regression algorithm. 
RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION :
Random forest regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. Ensemble learning method is a technique that combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model
A Random Forest is an ensemble technique capable of performing both regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision trees and a technique called Bootstrap and Aggregation, commonly known as bagging.
The main aim of this project is to predict the gold price, that is influenced by the economic variables such as stock profit exchange, silver price, EUR/USD, and United States oil ETF.
The machine learning algorithm random forest regressor is used to predict the price of gold accurately. Considering the results obtained, we conclude that the random forest regression model performed well.
We achieve an R Squared error Score of 0.99% which is high(It lies between 0-1)
